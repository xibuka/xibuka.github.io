From version 7, VIM has a built in spell check function, but disable by default.

# Enable/Disable

You can use ``` :set spell  ``` and ``` :set nospell``` to enable and disable it. The spell check isn't only for English, use ``` :echo &spelllang ``` to confirm the current target langurage. Use``` :set spelllang=en_GB.UTF-8 ``` to change the target langurage, also you can use ``` set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical ``` to set it to multiple langurage.

# Spell check

Use ```]s``` to move to the next, ``` [s ``` to move to the previous spell mistake.

# Correct the mistake

Use ``` z= ``` to list the suggestions of the spell mistake, and input a number
to select. 

For some special work, use ``` zg ``` to add it as user work. And use ``` zw ``` to delete it.
